# Install tools for the Windows App SDK

Configure your development computer with the tools required to build Windows apps using the [Windows App SDK](./index.md) (stable release channel) and [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/).

Before installing any tools, see [System requirements for Windows app development](system-requirements.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article applies only to the [stable release channel](./release-channels.md) of the Windows App SDK. For other release channels, see [Install tools for preview and experimental channels of the Windows App SDK](./preview-experimental-install.md).

## Install tools with winget

**[Visual Studio 2022 and later]** Install the required tools and workloads using the console and one of the following commands. These commands will open Visual Studio Installer with any missing workloads selected, for which you can select **Modify** to install the required workloads.

### For C# developers

### Required workloads and components

During Visual Studio installation, you have the option to install workloads and components (you can also open the Visual Studio Installer and select **Modify** to add workloads and components after installation). We recommend installing the following:

#### [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1 and later](#tab/vs-2022-17-1-a)

From within the Visual Studio Installer app:

* On the **Workloads** tab:

  * For C# app development using the Windows App SDK, select **.NET Desktop Development**.
    * Then in the **Installation details** pane of the installation dialog box, select **Windows App SDK C# Templates** (at the bottom of the list).
  * For C++ app development using the Windows App SDK, select **Desktop development with C++**
    * Then in the **Installation details** pane of the installation dialog box, select **Windows App SDK C++ Templates** (at the bottom of the list).
  * For Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app development, select **Universal Windows Platform development**
    * Then in the **Installation details** pane of the installation dialog box for that workload, make sure **C++ (v143) Universal Windows Platform tools** is selected.

* On the **Individual components** tab, in the **SDKs, libraries, and frameworks** section, make sure **Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0)** is selected.

#### [Other Visual Studio versions](#tab/vs-other)

From within the Visual Studio Installer app:

* On the **Workloads** tab:

  * For C# app development using the Windows App SDK, select **.NET Desktop Development**.
  * For C++ app development using the Windows App SDK, select **Desktop development with C++**.
  * For Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app development, select **Universal Windows Platform development**.
    * Then in the **Installation details** pane of the installation dialog box for that workload, make sure either **C++ (v143) Universal Windows Platform tools** (for Visual Studio 2022) or **C++ (v142) Universal Windows Platform tools** (for Visual Studio 2019) is selected.

## Visual Studio project and item templates

The [Windows App SDK](index.md) includes Visual Studio project and item templates for creating and developing apps that use the WinUI 3 library to implement the user interface.

### [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1 and later](#tab/vs-2022-17-1-b)

If you followed the instructions in [Required workloads and components](#required-workloads-and-components) above, the templates should already be installed.

Select **C#** or **C++** as the language, **Windows** as the platform, and **WinUI** as the Project type to create a new Windows App SDK project.

Optionally, install [Template Studio for WinUI (C#)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TemplateStudio.TemplateStudioForWinUICs) to accelerate the creation of new .NET WinUI apps using a wizard-based UI. Select from a variety of project types and features to generate a project template customized for you.

### [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0](#tab/vs-2022-17-0)

The templates are available by installing a Visual Studio extension (VSIX).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Windows App SDK Visual Studio extension (VSIX) already installed, then uninstall it before installing a new version. For directions, see [Manage extensions for Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions).

Download the extension directly, and install it:

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C# stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2022-cs)

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C++ stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2022-cpp)

### [Visual Studio 2019](#tab/vs-2019)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Visual Studio 2019 supports only Windows App SDK 1.1 and earlier. Visual Studio 2022 is recommended for developing apps with any version of the Windows App SDK.

The templates are available by installing a Visual Studio extension (VSIX).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Windows App SDK Visual Studio extension (VSIX) already installed, then uninstall it before installing a new version. For directions, see [Manage extensions for Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions).

* You can install the latest stable release VSIX from Visual Studio. Select **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**, search for *Windows App SDK*, and download the Windows App SDK extension. Close and reopen Visual Studio, and follow the prompts to install the extension.
* Alternatively, you can download the extension directly from Visual Studio Marketplace:

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C# stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2019-cs)

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download latest C++ stable release](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2019-cpp)

## Hybrid C/C++ runtime library linkage

In releases 1.0.3 and 1.1 Preview 2 and later, the Windows App SDK uses Hybrid C/C++ runtime library linkage (hybrid CRT linkage). This is a CRT linkage technique that simplifies deployment. Whether you're a C++ application developer or a C++ library developer, here are some resources for learning about hybrid CRT linkage:

* [Hybrid CRT linkage coding guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/docs/Coding-Guidelines/HybridCRT.md) on GitHub.
* The hybrid CRT linkage segment of the [WinUI community call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNHGU6xmUzE&t=977s) from April 20, 2022.

## Next steps

To create your first WinUI 3 app that uses the Windows App SDK, see [Create your first WinUI 3 project](../winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app.md).

Also see [Use the Windows App SDK in an existing project](use-windows-app-sdk-in-existing-project.md).
